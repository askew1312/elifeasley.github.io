          <!--I'm a data scientist at Khan Academy with a ton of views on education, data, social inequality, gender, Python coding standards, online dating, optimization, mental health, science communication, and misleading statistics. I'm super friendly and also insanely cynical. I do my best to use science to make learning as effective, meaningful, and enriching as it can be for everyone, everywhere. If you want an outdated, but more detailed view of me you can go to <a href="https://cs.utexas.edu/~elie">my old website</a>.-->
